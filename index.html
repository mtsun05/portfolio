          Hi! I'm Michael and I'm a sophomore at UIUC majoring in Computer
          Science and Economics. I am interested in using programming tools to
          develop effective and elegant solutions for business problems.

          <p class="section-header">about me</p>
          I recently transferred into Computer Science and Economics after
          realizing my previous major wasn't right for me. Since then, I've
          developed my programming skills through coursework, self study, and
          projects. I'm most comfortable in Python, C++ and JavaScript, and I have also worked with Java. I have experience building apps in Django.

              <p class="project-header">Volleytalk</p>
              Volleytalk is an app that I created to connect volleyball players
              and fans. I built it with <span class="bolded">Django</span class="bolded"> and
              <span class="bolded">Python</span class="bolded">, and styled with <span class="bolded">Bootstrap</span>. It has a forum,
              with liking and commenting, a rankings page, and a news page. It
              also supports user authentication.

          outside of programming, I love playing volleyball and ping pong,
          discovering new music, traveling, playing video games, and learning
          about anything—computer science, economics, global phenomena,
          quantitative finance, you name it!
